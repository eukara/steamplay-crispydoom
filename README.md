# Steam Play - Crispy Doom

If you'd like a convenient way to Crispy Doom in order to run games such as:

- The Ultimate Doom
- Doom II
- Final Doom (TNT: Evilution & Plutonia Effect)
- Master Levels for Doom II
- Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders
- HeXen: Beyond Heretic
- HeXen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel

Then this is the right tool for you.

There are a couple more Doom-Engine games on Steam, but they may not be
compatible. Feel free to send a pull request if you come across any that work.

# Dependencies
None, it expects your /bin/sh to handle arrays and things though.

And your own local copy of crispy-doom needs to be in $PATH.
This script will, currently, only *run* but not install anything.

# Installation
In order to install it, you just clone
the repository into your $HOME/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/ directory.

If the directory 'compatibilitytools.d' does not exist, make sure to create it.
